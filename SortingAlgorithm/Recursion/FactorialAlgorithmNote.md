# Factorial Algorithm
1. if num is equal to 0, the factorial is 1. Stop. We have the result. Otherwise..  
2. set multiplier to 1
3. set factorial to 1
4. while multiplier is not equal to num, do steps 5 and 6
5. multiply factorial by multiplier and assign the result to factorial 
6. add 1 to multiplier
7. stop. The result is factorial
